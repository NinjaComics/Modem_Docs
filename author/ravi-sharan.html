    </h2>
    <p><p>Recently I have been working on giving Comprehensive GNU Radio Archive Network
(CGRAN) a new look. While the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140829151613/https://www.cgran.org/wiki/Projects">old CGRAN site</a> was built using trac wiki pages,
the new one looks more like a standard website, with nitty-gritty details like
gnuradio version dependencies, tags associated with each OOT Module, more info
about OOT module developers, etc., all packed in one place. The site's built
using <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a> static site generator (Hey ! I use pelican for building this blog
as well :D) and uses bootstrap-material-design framework by Fez Vrasta, to style
the site. Design is not just the only attraction to this site - the module page
information is automated and most important of all, the site's tightly copuled
with <a class="reference external" href="http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/pybombs/wiki">PyBOMBS</a>. Read along to know more !</p>
<div class="section" id="design-idea">
<h2>Design Idea</h2>
<p>First off, the site's built with bits and pieces collected from different sources:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FezVrasta/bootstrap-material-design">Bootstrap Material Design framework</a> by Fez Vrasta(with some customization)
to style the site.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://bootstrap-table.wenzhixin.net.cn/">Bootstrap tables plugin</a> by Wenzhixin, to make life with tables easy(OOT Module
List).</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/joachimneu/pelican-md-metayaml">Pelican-md-metayaml</a> plugin to read the YAML metadata and generate Module
pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, while designing the site, I took a bit of linience in borrowing ideas from
two similar websites - <a class="reference external" href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://customelements.io/">customelements.io</a>. The front-page looks
similar to the <a class="reference external" href="http://customelements.io/">customelements.io</a> with more emphasis on the list of OOT Modules.
Unlike <a class="reference external" href="http://customelements.io/">customelements.io</a>, which is a standalone site for collection of various
polymer elemets, CGRAN is a part of the GNU Radio family and it was enough that
we display the condensed top-matter, as all the extra information concerning OOT
Modules is available on GNU Radio wiki. That said, there are relevant links on
the site to connect to the right wiki page :)</p>

<div class="section" id="rule-zero-pybombs-and-cgran">
<h2>Rule Zero : PyBOMBS and CGRAN</h2>
<p>Intelligent CGRAN and integrating it with PyBOMBS has been the top priority ever
since PyBOMBS task force came into picture. The idea is to automatically generate
a list of OOT modules available as PyBOMBS recipes and display them on CGRAN.</p>
<p>What does this mean ?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The OOT Module developer has to write a PyBOMBS recipe,</li>
<li>Pull a request for the recipe to be accpeted into PyBOMBS repo,</li>
<li>Fill in the details in the Manifest file created by gr-modtool, in the module
repo,</li>
<li>Sit back while the CGRAN site collects information about the new module and
generate a new page for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple isn't it ?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="module-pages-and-manifest">
<h2>Module Pages and Manifest</h2>
<p>I always liked the <a class="reference external" href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a>'s way of displaying a detailed information on its
package/theme on a separate page(that way, the user can stay in a place and get
more info about a project). I created the OOT Module pages in a similar fashion,
but <a class="reference external" href="https://atom.io/">atom.io</a> uses the package/theme's README to display information on it's project
info page. This doesn't fit the CGRAN model, as few already existing OOT Modules
have license embedded into their README file. Not only does the user have to
scroll down to get past the license information, it looks a bit odd on the
individual pages. So what did we do ?
Enter <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/n-west/manifests">Manifest.yaml</a> (the format's subject to change) !!! The Manifest.yaml
provides few mandatory fields to fill in, along with a description field, where
the OOT Module author can write any information regarding the module, which
he/she thinks will be of best interest to the user.</p>
<p>Now, why is YAML the preferred file format ?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is human readable</li>
<li>Easily readable on github (Assuming the OOT Modules reside on github)</li>
<li>CGRAN can scrape the necessary information to generate info for Module pages
in markdown format (remember intelligent CGRAN ?)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="let-s-talk-logo">
<h2>Let's talk Logo</h2>
<p>Finally, let's talk a bit about the logo. The new CGRAN logo is designed to
resemble an ecosystem of OOT Modules built around GNU Radio. <strong>Self-interest-alert-</strong>
I am a Dragon Ball fan. That's why there are exactly seven circles,(including
the GNU Radio circle) in the logo resembling the seven dragon balls spread across
as a network ;)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-next">
<h2>What Next ?</h2>
<p>While we have come far from a trac based site to an automated site for CGRAN,
more features (like repo stats, to name one) are to be implemented up the sleeve
without posing any overhead to the OOT Module authors.</p>
<p><em>P.S The current state of CGRAN could not have been achieved, if not for constant
inputs from Nathan West and other PyBOMBS Task Froce members :)</em></p>

    </h2>
    <p><p>Well, this is my first official post after starting this blog and after the
rather null <a class="reference external" href="http://ninjacomics.github.io/radioblogr/2014/07/Testpost.html">Testpost</a>. So here are few tips on starting to get to the right
3GPP specifications, irrespective of what standard you want to work on. When I
initially started reading the 3GPP specifications an year ago, I was not sure,
if the one I chose would provide me with the information I needed. Also, I was
really irritated by the fact that each and every line in any specification
pointed to several other specifications (and those pointed to several others.
Gosh ! I felt trapped in a loop of specs), but that's how specifications are
written and we have to deal with them.</p>
<p>So after going through lot of references provided in articles relevant to my
problem, I ended up choosing the correct set of specs. That's one way of
starting with the hunt for right set of specifications for your requirement.
And this is pretty much how anyone who is interested in continuing their
career in research will follow (atleast that's what I assume).
Once you zero in on which specs to follow, the right place to hit is the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.3gpp.org/specifications/specification-numbering">3GPP Specification matrix</a>. This matrix has all the specs sorted according
to their releases and refers to the respective standards(GSM, 3G, and 4G) with
respective specification series. Each sepecification series addresses different
areas of the stack and you can pick the newest and appropriate documents
suitable for your need.</p>
<p>While one can plunge into 3GPP Specification matrix directly, it is always a
good practice to spend some time referring the relevant articles/papers and
then come back to the matrix.</p>
<p>And coming to the heavy reference of specifications inside another
specification, you'll tend to ignore them once you get yourself more involved
into the specifications and hit the right ones automatically once you
understand them, which leaves me conveying the fact that, there is really no
workaround or special way to understand 3GPP specifications (fooling around
everyone who read this blog post for tips).</p>
