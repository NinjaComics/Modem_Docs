Happy news alert ! Got selected for this year's `Google Summer of Code (GSoC)`_
and will be contributing to GNU Radio as a part of it. Meaning, I will be 
updating the blog more often this summer - on a weekly basis to be precise. 
This is my second attempt at participating in GSoC, and I am glad to be part of
it this year. 

During the GSoC period, I will be working on 

* providing a GUI frontend for `Pybombs`_, 
* add Pybombs support to GNU Radio's embdedded working group and 
* finally, improve `CGRAN`_, and provide necessary documentation towards the end 
  of the program. 

In a nutshell, my contributions during the program will be to improve the user 
experience aspects of the GNU Radio project. If you follow planet GNU Radio's 
progress, watch out for some updates on Pybombs and CGRAN soon.

For now, keeping the post short and simple. Pip-pip !
