The `GSoC`_ community bonding period comes to an end in few hours from now and 
I am all excited and a tad bit nervous that the actual coding period starts 
from tomorrow. One good thing about the coding period is I don't have to carry
the burden of my semester work parallelly while I am contributing to Pybombs this
summer. Phew ! I am finally done with this semester's work.

Coming back to the community bonding period, I haven't really pushed any code 
or pulled any requests to the `Pybombs`_ repo during the pseudo coding period 
a.k.a community bonding period, but I now have a fairly decent idea on how 
Pybombs is shaping up and what areas I must be looking at during this summer, 
thanks to all the conversations that happened over the last one month on Pybombs'
bug tracker. 

Of all the issues raised on the Pybombs' bug tracker, issue `#304`_ and `#312`_
are of particular interest to me. The first one decides the way pybombs should
run while the second issue (although fixed and merged) is a step towards making
Pybombs build against Python3. Although, I was not successful at running pybombs
normally on a virtual environment supporting Python3, I will test it on a
machine which has Python3 as default, before jumping onto developing the 
graphical frontend for pybombs.

Apart from looking at the Pybombs' code base, I have spent some time on figuring
out the PyQt5 and it's availability on platforms other than Ubuntu. Now only 
thing that's left is the actual coding period that starts from tomorrow. Like 
always, watch out for more updates on Pybombs in the coming weeks. For now,
Pip pip !
