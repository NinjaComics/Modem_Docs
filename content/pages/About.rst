:slug:  about

I am Ravi Sharan, a Free Software enthusiast from Hyderabad. I am currently contracting as Research
Assistant at IIT Hyderabad (Yes ! There's an IIT in Hyderabad). My current research interests
include a mix and match of Cognitive Radio networks and GSM networks. As part of my everyday job,
I spend most of the time reading GSM specs and I recently started working on osmocom projects.
Apart from that, I love playing with my Raspberry Pi and occasionally build Android for my Nexus4.

A bit about the blog
********************

I have initially pondered a lot on what to call this blog and finally ended up with 
`/radio/bin/io`_ resembling the \*nix directory naming style ;)

- Entries related to radio go into the **/radio** category.
- Entries related to programming and software go into **/bin** category.
- The category **/io** is an abbreviation for "other information", with other and information
  interchanged. Entries in this category hold random ideas.

The content of the blog is generated using Pelican & reStructuredText and the blog is styled using
`pelican-sober`_ by `Florent Lebreton`_, with subtle changes. Finally, all the content available on
this blog is licensed under `CC BY-SA 4.0`_.
