:slug:  about

I am Ravi Sharan, a Free software enthusiast, currently pursuing MTech (Research Assistant)
1st year in Electrical Engineering, from IIT Hyderabad. My current research interests 
include a mix and match of Cognitive Radio networks and LTE Assisted Access (LAA).
I am currently working on opportunistic utilization of TV White Spaces in Indian context.

I go by the nickname - north on IRC and I almost always am available online, lurking on 
`GNU Radio`_ and `Osmocom`_ channels.

During my free time, I prefer reading books, mostly Sci-fi.   


A bit about the blog
********************

I have initially pondered a bit on what to call this blog and finally ended up
with `/radio/bin/io`_, resembling the \*nix directory naming style ;)

- Entries related to radio go into the **/radio** category.
- Entries related to programming and software go into **/bin** category.
- The category **/io** is an abbreviation for "other information", with other 
  and information interchanged. Entries in this category are either just
  random thoughts or personal rantings.
