I am Ravi Sharan, a Free Software enthusiast, contracting as Research Assistant 
at IIT Hyderabad. My current research interests include a mix and match of 
Cognitive Radio networks and Dynamic Spectrum Access techniques involving GSM
networks. Apart from that, I love playing with my Raspberry Pi and occasionally 
build Android for my Nexus4.

A bit about the blog
********************

I have initially pondered a bit on what to call this blog and finally ended up
with `/radio/bin/io`_, resembling the \*nix directory naming style ;)

- Entries related to radio go into the **/radio** category.
- Entries related to programming and software go into **/bin** category.
- The category **/io** is an abbreviation for "other information", with other 
  and information interchanged. Entries in this category are either just
  random thoughts or personal rantings.
